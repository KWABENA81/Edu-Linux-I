    Problem Statement
DOMAIN: Linux Fundamentals
Focus:  Development

Tom needs to create user accounts for new joiners Jane and Jack in his system and give them 
permission to view and edit common repositories.  

He needs to create a cron job to delete 
empty files and directory every day at 00:00 am and need to upgrade the system every week 
on Tuesday 6:00 am. As part of his role he also needs to monitor system usage (CPU load, 
Memory usage, disk usage, network usage, active logged in users). He needs to install Git as SCM in a remote system and put system usage 
data there. He would need to fetch the data on remote server and needs to maintain the 
remote server from his desktop as well. 

He also needs to restrict users to access youtube from this machine. 

Approach to Solve:
  1. Tom creates user accounts for Jane and Jack in his system.
      sudo useradd -m jane
      sudo useradd -m jack
      cat /etc/passwd | grep jane 
      jane:x:1001:1001::/home/jane:/bin/sh
      cat /etc/passwd | grep jack
      jack:x:1002:1002::/home/jack:/bin/sh
      sudo useradd -m tom
      cat /etc/passwd | grep tom
      tom:x:1003:1003::/home/tom:/bin/sh58 

  2. Separate home directories are created for each of the three users. 
        sudo mkdir /opt/common_repo
        sudo touch /opt/common_repo/common_script.sh
        sudo groupadd commongroup
        sudo usermod -a -G commongroup tom
        sudo usermod -a -G commongroup jane
        sudo usermod -a -G commongroup jack
        sudo chown -R tom:commongroup  /opt/common_repo/

        ls -ltr /opt/common_repo/
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 tom commongroup 0 Sep 17 16:50 common_script.sh

        ls -ltr /opt/
        drwxrwxrwx 2 tom  commongroup 4096 Sep 17 16:50 common_repo

  3. They have a common repository script where every user has access to view and edit files.
        $ cd /opt/common_repo            
        $ pwd
        /opt/common_repo
        drwxrwxrwx 3 tom  commongroup 4096 Sep 17 17:29 common_repo
        getent group commongroup | awk -F: '{print $4}'
          tom,jane,jack

  4. Tom installed git as the SCM in a remote system.
       
        $ git init
        hint:   git branch -m <name>
        Initialized empty Git repository in /opt/common_repo/.git/
        $ ls -l
        total 0
        -rwxrwxrwx 1 tom commongroup 0 Sep 17 16:50 common_script.sh
        $ ls -la
        total 12
        drwxrwxrwx 3 tom  commongroup 4096 Sep 17 17:09 .
        drwxr-xr-x 6 root root        4096 Sep 17 16:49 ..
        -rwxrwxrwx 1 tom  commongroup    0 Sep 17 16:50 common_script.sh
        drwxrwxr-x 7 tom  tom         4096 Sep 17 17:09 .git
        $ git config --global init.defaultBranch main  

        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        Agent pid 21909
        $ ssh-add /home/tom/.ssh/id_ed25519
        Identity added: /home/tom/.ssh/id_ed25519 (kwabenasefa@hotmail.com)

        $ cat /home/tom/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIK2p1oysi3JoorwRWfRl/x610GVhhiTRU7w8zyOH3IKQ kwabenasefa@hotmail.com

  5. He set a cron job to delete empty files and directory from /tmp folder at 00:00 am.
    	0 0 * * * /root/tmp_cleanup.sh
      --
      # 
      # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)

      -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   25 Sep 18 01:35 tmp_cleanup.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        rm -r /tmp/*



  6. He set a cron job to upgrade the system every week on Tuesday 6:00 am.
    # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
      # 
      # m h  dom mon dow   command
      0 5 * * TUE /root/system_upgrade.sh

  7. Tom creates a script which has functionalities to display 
              CPU load, Memory usage,  disk usage, network usage, active logged in users.
  8. He puts them in git repository. 
  9. He runs the scripts to get data for remote server to check and maintain the remote server from his desktop.
  10. He restricts users to access youtube from this machine
